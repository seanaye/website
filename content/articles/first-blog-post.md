## The Beginning

My first job in Design was by chance. Students throw applications at dozens of companies in hopes of getting an interview. Sometimes for jobs they aren't entirely qualified for or know much about, especially in when work experience is lacking. That was me when I applied for the UX/UI Designer job at GM's Innovation Lab. The interview went well, and I got the offer. No design experience, not really sure what I was getting into, but I liked the interviewers and the job sounded cool. Co-op secured!

## Design Thinking

At GM, I was exposed to the design thinking framework.

At a high level, the goal of design thinking is to continuously put innovators in the shoes of their customers. It ensures that the designer understands the problems users encounter and results in a higher likelihood that the defined problem is actually worth solving. It encourages crazy ideas, and makes users cast the deciding vote on product success. Ultimately, it allows companies to test and validate ideas cheaply, before committing massive amounts of resources to a project.

## Other Frameworks

Other methods exist to rapidly test ideas. Sprints (shown below), for example, are a common way teams work nowadays. In sprints, teams go through the design process from empathize to test in one week. The goal is, once again, rapid testing and validation.

There are many other frameworks that exist. The Lean Startup which is a "build-measure-learn" feedback loop is quite similar. All of these can be combined in an Agile or [insert next buzzword] team. The names don't matter and neither to the exact steps. The importance rings true in most applications that I've been a part of. In sum, find out if your problem is the worth solving, test ideas quickly and cheaply, and once validated, start implementation.

## User Testing

Listening to users is the most powerful way to convince yourself, and your manager, of an idea. Whether it be through exploratory interviews, reading through customer complaint emails, whatever, just listen to them. Generally, users that complain care and want to see something improved. Think of the last time you complained. Maybe I speak for myself, but the point is that you need to take the time to understand your users.

Once an actual prototype (or product) is built, get users to test that product. They'll think of things that never crossed your mind. When user testing a prototype, it's important to ask open ended questions and let them use your product as they would in their environment. Asking, "how do you feel about the product?" instead of "do you like the product?", allows the user to speak their mind yielding valuable information as opposed to a simple yes/no answer that would be of little to no benefit.

When interviewing/testing, having a second person dedicated to note taking is ideal. It'll free up the interviewer focus on the interview. Additionally, while users are testing the product, let them try to figure it out for themselves. If it wasn't simple enough for them to use on their own, take that information and go back to the drawing board.

## Designer Tools

Personas, mood boards, wireframes, blah, blah, there are one million ways to do the same thing. I find the design world gets far too in love with the idea of a design process. The process changes every project!

Slrrrrrrp. What's that?! Ah, it's just the design process Kool Aid.

You don't always need wireframes. You don't always need personas. You don't always need to follow a cookie cutter process. For those of us in the design world, this might ring a bell.

<span style="background-color: #E0E7FF; font-weight: 600">"Hey team! Please keep in mind that we are designing for Lucy. A 16-year-old, female with eye problems. She loves going to the mall on Saturdays at 10am (they spoke to one person about this). She loves apple products, and she is loyal to brands x y and z."</span>

Right thanks! That'll surely influence my design...

Okay I may have exaggerated, but the point still stands. Most of the personas I've encountered in my short design career have had little to no influence on the outcome of designs. Yes, understand who your users are, but understand who they are in a way that'll actually inform your design. Most times, personas make for pretty PowerPoint slides, but lack actionable information.

In the above case, telling the engineering team they need to account for: young users and poor eyesight would have resonated a little better. My two cents.

## Quantifying Design

Quantifying design can be hard. If you have a travel app with the goal of getting users to book trips, which of the metrics below would be best?

1. Amount of users that create an account,
2. Percentage of users complete trip bookings, or
3. Number of times a destination is selected

One million destinations could be selected with no one using the product as intended. Often, I see the amount of button clicks or page views be measure of success, but realistically, the goal is to convert users to booking trips. Having 50 users and 5 booked trips is far better than 100,000 users and 0 booked trips. The answer is the second metric.

<span style="background-color: #E0E7FF; font-weight: 600">Your design metrics should line up with product metrics. Focus on the goal of the product, not the micro-interactions. </span>

This isn't to say random metrics can be useful to track. They can reveal interesting patterns in user behaviour. However, they shouldn't be used as a guiding light for your product.

## Importance of UI

Though I am not a UI Designer, I have been privileged to learn from good ones. UI sets the tone for an entire product. The amount of detail that's needed to have a harmonious, accessible and recognizable design is incredible. When testing products in early stages, a full-blown UI isn't necessary. When moving into implementation, I'd recommend having a good look at the UI.

These days, many people (myself included) will instantly ditch an application that doesn't meet a bare minimum of satisfaction from a UI (and UX) standpoint. If a product has good UI, it instantly makes users feel more secure about their decision to use your product. Keep that in mind when trying to generate traction. The design need not be perfect right away, but a solid foundation should be in place.

## Client vs. In-house Design

At GM and ODS (Ontario Digital Service), I worked for in-house design teams. We did things specifically for our company and everything was internal. At Rangle.io, a design agency, I worked on an external client project. I was lucky to get experience in both, learning some new tricks along the way (appeasing clients with nice food, anyone?). I want to be a client.

Back to the point, when working in either format you have clients. In-house clients are the teams you are working for. Keeping clients in the loop is crucial throughout the entire design process. It prevents the awkward meeting where design has been completed in the dark for a few days and opinions on both sides start flying when something new shows up. How to lose control of a meeting 101. Proper communication results in happy stakeholders

Proper communication doesn't mean you need to get approval for every single change you make. In fact, design/dev teams should have the authority to take leaps of faith where they see fit. It's quite ironic when companies say they're "agile", yet teams aren't able to pivot without "sign-off".

If you don't trust your design team (in-house or clients) with autonomy, hire a new design team.

## Design to PM

After three design co-ops, I was becoming starting to specialize in design as far as a co-op student is concerned. I decided to take a leap and try Product Management as I felt it utilizes my skillset more effectively. I found the work to be rewarding as well.

That's where I've ending up post-graduation. I'll be starting a full-time PM role in the fall. I'll always be an advocate for good design and the learnings from the design world will surely stick with me throughout my career.
